# BuildingPermitWebScraper
A web scraper written in Python for gathering permit information from Louisville Metro's Permit Database. This program was initailly written in January of 2022 to allow me to download the metadata for Louisville Metro's building permits, which I needed to complete my Senior Thesis at the University of Louisville. It will gather the number bedroom, number of dwelling units, square footage, and estimated cost of each permit provided. It then organizes them into a CSV file for analysis.
# Instructions
1. To run this program you will need Python 3, Selenium (a Python extension that can be installed using pip), Google Chrome, and the Google Chrome webdriver (available here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). 
2. After the dependencies are installed make sure, Google Chrome and Chrome Webdriver are accesible through the PATH environment variable.
3. From here follow the instruction provided in the Python file.
